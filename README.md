# sudoku-solver-algorithm
This project features a sudoku solver algorithm programmed in C++ featuring backpropagation.
The script uses the CLI as a user interface.
When inputting values in the grid, each box on the grid is attributed a coordinate $x$ and $y$. The numbering of rows and columns starts from the top-left of the sudoku grid at (1, 1).
When done inputting the base numbers of the sudoku, insert 0 and 0 as $x$ and $y$.
For testing purposes, input -1 -1 as $x$ and $y$ to get a pre-filled sudoku ready to be solved.
