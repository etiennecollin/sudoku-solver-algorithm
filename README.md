# sudoku-solver-algorithm
**This project features a sudoku solver algorithm programmed in C++ featuring backpropagation.**

## Usage
The script uses the CLI as a user interface. Run the [Sudoku](https://github.com/etiennecollin/sudoku-solver-algorithm/blob/main/Sudoku) file in your terminal.

When inputting values in the grid, each box on the grid is attributed a coordinate $x$ and $y$. The numbering of rows and columns starts from the top-left of the sudoku grid at (1, 1). When done inputting the base numbers of the sudoku, insert 0 and 0 as $x$ and $y$.

## Note:
For testing purposes, input -1 -1 as $x$ and $y$ to get a pre-filled sudoku ready to be solved.
